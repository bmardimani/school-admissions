school-admissions
=================
We are trying to understand how families discover, apply and enroll in their school. We want to help families and students easily get the school information they want, in a way that they understand. We will enable them to discover their school options and to more easily apply to schools.

We will share what weâ€™ve learned about what parents are looking for, how they feel about the process, and the options or lack of options. 


Right now we are working on Phase I, understanding the diversity of application process.
